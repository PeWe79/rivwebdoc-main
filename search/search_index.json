This tool is not developed by the developers for Rivendell Radio Automation. How project started This system started by Andreas Olsson, working on a local organization radio station in Sweden. The lack of using vpn and not an easy way of doing voice tracking, and manage other stuff. After looking around the world wide web, there was an old script, created by Brian McGlynn but it uses old php version so it needed to be fix to work with todays php version. Andreas is an learn thru google search programmer, and likes to learn. And also spends to much time on the computer (if you ask his girlfriend). He fixed the most bugs, so it can be used for voice tracking. But he needed more and more today looking design. So he started to work on Rivendell Web Broadcast. What is Rivendell Web System Rivendell Web System is an tool to manage the most parts of Rivendell Radio Automation, it must be installed on the same machine as a Rivendell host is. It uses the API that Rivendell has, but it's missing many functions so many parts of this web system works directly to Rivendell database. What you need to know This system is still under heavy develop and can contain bugs, function that do not work, parts that not has built in yet, so it's not recommended to use it on live production machine.

For the moment there are no server check in the installer so you need to do this process first. Info This guide is for Debian based system Install Dependencies Apache Normally apache is installed during installation of Rivendell, but if not, you need to install it with following command: sudo apt install apache2 -y mod_rewrite To be able to use the system you need apache modrewrite installed. This is done by enable the apache module: sudo a2enmod rewrite Then you need to make changes in your apache config to allow .htaccess files: Open up config file : sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf Go and make sure that directory /var/www is set to AllowOverride All PHP This is developed to work with PHP version 8 but will work on version 7 also. Install php with following: sudo apt install php php-{common,mysql,xml,xmlrpc,curl,gd,imagick,cli,dev,imap,mbstring,opcache,soap,zip,intl,pdo} -y This will install PHP and modules that are common and needed. Now restart apache: sudo systemctl restart apache2 FFMPEG For the moment we use FFMPEG to get the length of the audio files, this will be removed in the future, but for now you need to install FFMPEG on your server: sudo apt install ffmpeg Install System Now we are going to install the system on your server. This must be done on a server that has rivendell installed. Start by login to root user: su -l Go to apache folder: cd /var/www/html and remove the index file: rm index.html Stable versions A release file is \"more stable\" than the \"github\" code, when we update the version number we release a new release. This can contain less bugs, than clone the github code. And we recommend this way. Download the latests release and extract it inside the /var/www/html folder. Development versions If you want the latest changes in the system, Clone the github repository inside the html folder. Warning This is the development and changes a lot and can hold many bugs! Data Folder Chmod the data folder so it get read and write access. This folder store json settings files for the system, logeditor and password reset. Reverse Proxy It's recommended that you use reverse proxy with https access before you expose the machine on the world wide web. For testing you can use http://localhost Audio recording needs https access to work, but they will work on localhost also. Run the installer Open up Rivendell Web Broadcast on your browser to start installation. You will have to fill out some important settings first. All settings can be changed later in the system. Admin user Under the admin user field you enter your or anyones username on rivendell with normal user access on rivendell. This user will get admin access to the web system. Info Rivendells Admin user can not be used in this system Just enter one username now, you can add more later. SMTP Settings The SMTP settings are used to send out emails in the system and is required. Updates In the admin dashboard you will get information when a new release is avalible, This will only inform when there are new release on the release page on github.
