Above the track editor you will find Play, Pause, Stop, Go to start, Go to end. And you will also find Zoom In and Zoom Out.

The headphone button will enable you to set cursor position where you want the player to start play. The dobble arrow button enable track moving. This will allow you to move your tracks.

    The first track is not possible to move.

The right arrow up button allows you to set a fade up marker on the track. And the right arrow down button allows you to set fade down marker on the track.

When you are done press Save button.
